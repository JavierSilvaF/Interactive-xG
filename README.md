	<h1># Interactive-xG</h1>
	xG is a Measure based in probability of whether a given shot will result in a goal, the better the xG, the better the chance is.

 	A xG of 1 would mean a guaranteed goal everytime (which is impossible in real life).
  	An exceptional strikers would be the one who exceeds the average striker most of the time(the xG), has a positive G-xG diferential.
  	It's worth noting that sometimes exceptional strikers will have a big xG and at the same time a low G-xG diferential meaning that
  	the striker positions himself properly and usually manages to convert those chances.

  	Even if xG isn't the best metric to measure Goalkeepers, it's really good to measure the chances that your defence is letting go through. In the same vein
  	Goalkeepers that that have a negative diferential (GoalsAgainst-xG) will prove that they're better than the average goalkeeper.
